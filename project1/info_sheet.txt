Additional comments to the grader:
  Unsure if this is just a result of my code, but once you select an option to run on the driver, it takes a bit to display the shape.
  You can just hit ENTER again after selecting a number and it will come up right away. Otherwise wait like 5 seconds. Everything still
  works as it should, just a small thing I thought I would point out!
